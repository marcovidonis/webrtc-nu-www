# possible survey

One really good early idea was to send out a survey via the existing local user groups
Let's use this page to draft the intro/questions

## intro

This survey aims to try and provide informal answers to some questons that have come up in the W3C WebRTC working group sessions
your answers will be collated and presented in aggregate to a future working group session which will hopefully make for standards that better meet your needs

## questions that have come up recently in the W3C
### Your dev experience of the WebRTC API
1) I work with the WebRTC APIs every day
2) I regularly use the WebRTC APIs
3) I occasionally need to use WebRTC APIs
4) I only use WebRTC via a library - never directly to the w3c APIs
5) I manage a team who use the webRTC APIs
6) I never used the webRTC APIs

### Async functions in javascript APIs
1) Async functions make life easy
2) Async functions can make APIs cleaner but do add complexity
3) Async functions are to be avoided if possible
4) Callbacks forever

### SDP mungeing 
Our WebRTC (in-browser) javascript :
1) rewrites SDP often
2) occasionally rewrites SDP because suitable APIs don't exist
3) never rewrites SDP 

### Data channels in WebWorkers
Our WebRTC application:
1) doesn't use datachannels
2) uses data channels, but they are ok on the main thread
3) uses data channels but it would be better if they could run in their own workers.

### Learning the API
Developers new to WebRTC find it:
1) easy to pickup
2) complex but ok
3) very difficult
4) a reason to change jobs
